### Main technologies used
  <p> 
    
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/) - JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to 
be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
document written in a markup language 
such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, 
as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of May 2019,
jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.
